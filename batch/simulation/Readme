Initiate batch job simulation with the following command

gluex_MC.py ConfigFile RunNumber NEvents per_file=NEventsPerFile batch=1

where each of the following  

ConfigFile: contains the MCWrapper configuration parameters (see gen_omegapi.config)
RunNumber: is the run number for your events (for Spring 2017 between 30274 and 31057)
NEvents: is the # of events you want to generate
NEventsPerFile: is the # of events to simulate for each job/file (5000 is a good number)

To submit many jobs, through qsub, to the W&M HPC nodes us batch=1.  Otherwise you can generate a small number of events (<5000) interactively by running the same command with batch=0.
