Documentation and scripts for GlueX groups use of W&M HPC resources:

To get started clone this repository in your home directory on one of the HPC machines (eg. vortex.sciclone.wm.edu) by executing the following commands:

cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/jrstevenjlab/wm_gluex.git

Then source the setup.csh script to set your environment variables:

cd wm_gluex
source setup.csh

Now you should have access to root, python, etc. for running some basic analysis tutorials.
